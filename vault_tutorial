Definition- Ansible Vault is a feature of Ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or other secrets in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in your playbooks or roles.



Setup Vault:

1.Create a password for vault
  openssl rand -base64 2048 > vault.pass

2.Add your AWS credentials using the below vault command
  ansible-vault create group_vars/all/pass.yml --vault-password-file vault.pass\

3.Edit password file 
  ansible-vault edit group_vars/all/pass.yml --vault-password-file vault.pass

4.Decrypt file --> ansible-vault decrypt <file_name> --vault-password-file <pass location>

5.Explore other options --> ansible-vault
 
6.Encrypt Password --> ansible-vault encrypt_string foobar --vault-password-file vault.pass

7.Decrypt Password -->  ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml

8.View an encrypted file --> ansible-vault view secret.yml

9.Change password of an encrypted file --> ansible-vault rekey secret.yml


# Prompt for the vault password
   ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass

   # Use a password file (make sure this file is secured!)
   ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt

   # Use a script that returns the password
   ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.py
